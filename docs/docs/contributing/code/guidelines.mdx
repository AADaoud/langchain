# General guidelines

Here are some things to keep in mind for all types of contributions:

- Follow the ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) workflow. Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.
- Use the checked-in pull request template when opening pull requests. Note related issues and tag relevant maintainers.
- Ensure your PR passes formatting, linting, and testing checks before requesting a review.
  - If you would like comments or feedback on your current progress, you can instead mark your PR as a draft.
  - See the sections on [Testing](/docs/contributing/code/technical_logistics#testing) and [Formatting and Linting](/docs/contributing/code/technical_logistics#formatting-and-linting) for how to run these checks locally.
- Backwards compatibility is key. Your changes must not be breaking, except in case of critical bug and security fixes.
- Look for duplicate PRs or issues that have already been opened before opening a new one.
- Keep scope as isolated as possible. As a general rule, your changes should not affect more than one package at a time.

## Bugfixes

We welcome bugfixes to existing functionality, but ask that you communicate the issue in as much detail as you can to help
maintainers understand and reproduce the bug.

- Open an accompanying GitHub issue and link to it in the PR.
- Do not break or modify existing functionality, unless the fix is for a critical security issue.
- Include unit tests that a maintainer can use to reproduce the issue. This will also provide coverage against future regressions.

## New features

We aim to keep the bar high for new features. We generally don't accept new core abstractions, changes to infra, changes to dependencies,
or new agents/chains from outside contributors without an existing GitHub discussion or issue that demonstrates an acute need for them.

- New features must come with docs, unit tests, and (if appropriate) integration tests.
- New integrations must come with docs, unit tests, and (if appropriate) integration tests.
  - See [this page](/docs/contributing/integrations) for more details on contributing new integrations.
- New functionality should not inherit from or use a deprecated methods or classes.
- We will reject features that are likely to lead to security vulnerabilities or reports.
- Do not add any hard dependencies. Integrations may add optional dependencies.
